## What Is AgentQT?

AgentQT is a full development operating system built on top of Claude Code — but its foundations are not new. They are borrowed directly from decades of proven software engineering practice.

### Built on Industry-Standard Engineering Principles

AgentQT encodes the Waterfall SDLC — one of the most proven and widely adopted models in enterprise and safety-critical software engineering — directly into Claude's workflow.

**Waterfall SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**

The Waterfall model — defined in the 1970s and still the backbone of regulated, safety-critical, and enterprise software — divides development into sequential, non-overlapping phases where each phase must be completed and signed off before the next begins. Every requirement, design decision, and test case is documented before code is written, creating a clear audit trail from business objective to deployed software.

```
Requirements → System Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
```

AgentQT maps this model directly onto every feature:

| Waterfall Phase | AgentQT Artifact | Enforced By |
|---|---|---|
| Requirements | FO + SRD (Functional Objective + Software Requirements) | SRD status guard — code blocked until `Approved` |
| System Design | DD (Design Document) | `artifact-validator` checks parent references |
| Module Design | MD (Module Definition) | File paths required before `phase-gate` passes |
| Test Planning | UTCD (Unit Test Case Document) | Written before code — TDD gate |
| Implementation | Code | Only after `phase-gate` returns GO |
| Verification | Tests pass ≥ 80% coverage | Coverage gate in CI |
| Release | RN (Revision Note) | Produced after every implementation block |

The key discipline borrowed from Waterfall: **no phase can be skipped, and each phase produces a document that the next phase depends on.** The `phase-gate` agent enforces this mechanically — it will block code generation if any upstream artifact is missing or unapproved.

### What AgentQT Adds on Top

The Waterfall model was designed for human teams following paper-based processes. AgentQT makes it executable by an AI agent:

- **11 specialized sub-agents** enforce each phase gate automatically — no human has to remember the process
- **12 slash commands** run full pipelines (FO through Revision Note) in one invocation
- **Hooks** keep the code index self-maintaining — agents orient from `MODULE_MAP.json` instead of reading full source files
- **Tiered model routing** — lightweight gates (Haiku) vs. design and code work (Sonnet) — keeps token costs proportional to task complexity

The framework lives entirely in `.claude/` and is portable — drop it into any Python/PyQt6 project.

---

## The Artifact Chain

Every feature follows a mandatory, validated pipeline before a single line of code is written:

```
FO → SRD → DD → MD → UTCD → Code → Tests → RN
(objective) (requirements) (design) (modules) (test cases)          (revision note)
```

- **FO** defines *what* to build and why
- **SRD** specifies exact requirements with Must/Should/Could priority — only `Approved` SRDs can be implemented
- **DD** documents *how* — data flow, class design, edge cases
- **UTCD** test cases are written *before* code (TDD-aligned)
- `artifact-validator` checks ID chains and parent references after every phase — GO/NO-GO gate
- `phase-gate` verifies all SRDs are Approved and test cases exist before implementation starts
- `session-finalizer` auto-syncs `TRACE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, and `DEVLOG.md` at session end

---

## Why AgentQT

**The core problem with vanilla AI coding:** Each session starts cold. The AI has no memory of what was built, why decisions were made, or what comes next. Requirements drift, code diverges from intent, and there is no audit trail.

**What AgentQT solves:**

- **Zero context loss between sessions** — `AGENT_BOOT.md` + `CONTEXT.md §0` + `DEVLOG.md` give any agent or human a full picture in one read
- **Requirements drive code, not the other way around** — coding is blocked until the SRD is Approved; the `phase-gate` agent enforces this automatically
- **Full traceability** — `TRACE.md` links FO → SRD → DD → MD → UT → RN in one table; `artifact-validator` catches broken chains
- **Token efficiency by design** — Haiku handles all lightweight gates (validation, duplicate detection, session sync); Sonnet only fires for design and code work
- **Self-maintaining code index** — `refresh_skeleton.py` hook updates `MODULE_MAP.json` after every `.py` edit; agents query it instead of reading full source files
- **SRD status as a living contract** — `Draft → Approved → Implemented → Verified` statuses enforce who can change what and when

---

## Token Efficiency

Token cost is the real cost of AI-assisted development. AgentQT treats token consumption as a first-class engineering concern — every design decision in the framework has a direct impact on how many tokens a task consumes.

### Tiered Model Routing

Not all tasks require the same intelligence. AgentQT assigns a fixed model to every agent based on the complexity of what it does:

| Tier | Model | Cost | Used For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lightweight** | Haiku | ~20× cheaper than Opus | Artifact validation, duplicate detection, phase gate checks, session sync |
| **Standard** | Sonnet | Balanced cost/capability | All code writing, code review, GUI design, test writing, prompt evaluation |

The five cheapest agents in the pipeline — `duplicate-detector`, `artifact-validator`, `phase-gate`, `session-finalizer`, and the banner hook — all run on Haiku. Sonnet only fires when design thinking or code generation is actually required. A full feature pipeline from FO to RN typically invokes Haiku 4–5 times and Sonnet 3–4 times, rather than running every step on the most expensive model available.

### Scoped File Reads

In a typical AI coding session, the model reads entire files to get oriented — even when only one function needs changing. AgentQT eliminates this with two mechanisms:

- **`MODULE_MAP.json`** — a machine-generated index of every class, method signature, and docstring in the codebase. Agents query it via CLI (`skeleton_extractor query --class ClassName`) instead of reading source files. A query returns ~20 lines instead of ~500.
- **Prompt classification** — `CLAUDE.md §1` defines four prompt classes (Q, N, D, S) with explicit file-read rules per class. A status check (Class N) reads only `CONTEXT.md §0`. A routine bug fix (Class D) reads only the active tool's docs. A cold session start (Class S) reads `AGENT_BOOT.md` once. No class ever reads the entire codebase.

### Agent Invocation Guards

Every agent has explicit rules for when **not** to invoke it — documented in `AGENT_BOOT.md §6`:

- Bug fix on a single module → skip the architect agent entirely
- Comment-only or doc-only change → skip all agents including `artifact-validator` and `session-finalizer`
- Refactor within one file → skip architect; run reviewer after
- `phase-gate` → skip for bug fixes on already-Implemented SRDs
- `duplicate-detector` → skip when input is an existing artifact ID — anchor already known

These guards prevent the most common source of token waste in multi-agent systems: agents firing on tasks where they add no value.

---

## Productivity Impact

AgentQT is designed to compress the time between a requirement and working, tested, traceable code — without sacrificing engineering discipline.

### Where Productivity Is Gained

**Eliminated rework from context loss.**
In a standard AI workflow, each new session requires re-explaining the project, its decisions, and its current state — often consuming 30–50% of a session just re-establishing context. `AGENT_BOOT.md` + `CONTEXT.md §0` + `DEVLOG.md` reduce cold-start time to a single read, typically under 30 seconds.

**Eliminated rework from requirement drift.**
Without a requirements gate, AI-generated code frequently diverges from intent over multiple sessions. The SRD status guard (`Draft → Approved → Implemented → Verified`) means code is only written once — against an approved, stable specification. Rewrites caused by shifting requirements drop significantly.

**Parallelised quality gates.**
Code review, simplification, and traceability sync happen automatically as part of the pipeline — not as separate manual steps. A developer does not need to remember to run the reviewer, update `TRACE.md`, or write the revision note. These steps are triggered by the commands and hooks.

**Self-documenting codebase.**
Because every module carries its MD ID and every test carries its UTCD ID, the codebase is always auditable. Finding why a function exists, what requirement it satisfies, and which test covers it takes seconds — not a archaeology session through commit history.

### Productivity by Phase

| Phase | Without AgentQT | With AgentQT |
|---|---|---|
| Session startup | 10–20 min re-explaining context | < 1 min — read `CONTEXT.md §0` |
| Requirement definition | Ad-hoc, often skipped | Structured FO + SRD with status guard |
| Design | Implicit, in the AI's head | Explicit DD — reviewable, reusable |
| Code orientation | Read full source files | Query `MODULE_MAP.json` — 20 lines |
| Code review | Manual or skipped | Automatic — `pyqt-code-reviewer` / `code-reviewer` |
| Traceability | None | Auto-synced `TRACE.md` at session end |
| Cross-session continuity | Lost | Persistent via `DEVLOG.md` + `CONTEXT.md` |

---

## Comparison

| Approach | Traceability | Context Retention | Quality Gates | Token Efficiency | Repeatability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plain prompts | None | None | None | Wasteful | Low |
| Single `CLAUDE.md` | None | Minimal | Ad-hoc | Moderate | Moderate |
| `CLAUDE.md` + memory | Partial | Good | Ad-hoc | Moderate | Moderate |
| **AgentQT** | Full FO→RN | Persistent + structured | Automated, multi-stage | Optimized by tier | High |

**Rating: 9 / 10**

AgentQT scores 9/10 for solo and small-team projects lasting more than a few weeks: the AI never loses context, requirements are enforced before code is written, every module is traceable, and token costs are managed by tier routing. The one point deducted is for onboarding cost — 11 agents, 12 commands, 4 rule files, and a skeleton extractor is a real investment that only pays off on projects with depth and longevity.
