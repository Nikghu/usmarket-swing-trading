## FO-EXE-001: Risk-Controlled Order Submission

- The system shall receive trade signals from the Analysis Engine and validate each one against risk rules before submitting any order to IBKR.
- For each validated signal the system shall calculate position size using a configurable fixed-risk model: `position_size = (account_risk_per_trade × account_equity) / (entry_price − stop_loss_price)`.
- The system shall enforce the following pre-trade risk controls:
  - **Max position per symbol** — maximum dollar exposure per single position (configurable).
  - **Max capital allocation** — maximum percentage of total equity deployed across all open positions simultaneously (configurable default: 50%).
  - A signal that would breach either limit is **rejected** and logged; no order is submitted.
- Accepted orders shall be submitted to IBKR as **market orders** by default (configurable to limit orders at signal price ± configurable slippage buffer).
- The system shall persist every submitted order (order ID, symbol, side, quantity, order type, timestamp) to the `trades` table immediately upon submission.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Given a BUY signal, account equity = $100,000, risk-per-trade = 1%, entry = $50.00, stop = $48.00 → position size = 500 shares.
  - Given a BUY signal that would push total deployed capital above the max allocation limit, the signal is rejected with a logged reason and no order submitted.
  - A submitted market order appears in the `trades` table within 1 second of submission with a non-null IBKR order ID.
  - Given `order_type = limit`, the submitted order uses a limit price = entry_price (not a market order).

---

## FO-EXE-002: Position Tracking & Exit Execution

- The system shall maintain an in-memory and database-persisted snapshot of all open positions **per user** (symbol, user_id, quantity, average entry price, stop-loss level, target price, trailing-stop level, mode, state).
- Exit signals from the Analysis Engine (stop-loss, target reached, trailing-stop triggered) shall be executed immediately as market orders against the full open position size.
- On order fill confirmation from IBKR, the system shall:
  - Update the `positions` table (clear position if fully closed).
  - Update the `trades` table with exit time, exit price, and calculated PnL.
  - Emit a position-closed event to all subscribers (logging, monitoring, reporting).
- The system shall reconcile open positions against the IBKR account state on startup (in case of prior unclean shutdown) and re-adopt any unrecognised open positions.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - An open long position of 500 AAPL shares receives a stop-loss exit signal → a SELL 500 AAPL market order is submitted within 1 second.
  - After fill confirmation, the `positions` table for AAPL shows quantity = 0.
  - PnL for the trade is calculated as `(exit_price − entry_price) × quantity` and stored in `trades`.
  - On startup with an existing IBKR open position not in the local database, the system re-adopts it and logs a reconciliation warning.

## FO-EXE-003: Daily Loss Circuit Breaker & Emergency Controls

- The system shall track total realised PnL for the current trading day.
- When the day's cumulative loss reaches or exceeds a configurable **max daily loss** threshold (default: 2% of start-of-day equity), the system shall:
  - Immediately cancel all pending open orders.
  - Close all open positions at market.
  - Suspend further signal processing for the remainder of the day.
  - Log a CRITICAL event and emit an alert notification.
- The system shall provide a manual emergency kill-switch (CLI command or keyboard shortcut in any GUI) that immediately triggers the same close-all-and-halt sequence.
- After a circuit-breaker trigger, the system shall require a manual restart to resume trading on the next trading day.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Given start-of-day equity = $100,000 and max-daily-loss = 2%, when cumulative realised loss reaches −$2,000, all positions are closed and no further orders are submitted for the rest of the day.
  - A CRITICAL log entry is produced, and the alert notification fires, within 5 seconds of the threshold breach.
  - After circuit-breaker activation, a new entry signal arriving for any symbol is silently discarded (not executed).
  - The manual kill-switch closes all positions within 10 seconds regardless of current system state.

## FO-EXE-004: Paper Trading Mode

> Traces to: `requirements.md` §23

- The system shall support **paper trading** (simulated execution) alongside live trading, togglable per user.
- Paper trading shall use identical strategy logic, risk rules, and position management as live trading — only order submission is simulated.
- Simulated order fills: market orders fill immediately at current price; limit orders fill when price crosses the limit level.
- Paper trades and positions shall be stored in the unified `trades` and `positions` tables with `mode = 'paper'` — no separate paper tables.
- Paper P&L shall be calculated identically to live P&L.
- No IBKR API order calls shall be made during paper execution; live market data is used for price reference.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Given a user in paper mode, a BUY signal generates a simulated fill (no IBKR `place_order()` call); the trade appears in the `trades` table with `mode = 'paper'`.
  - Paper and live trades for the same user are distinguishable by `mode` column.
  - Paper P&L matches what live P&L would have been for identical entry/exit prices.
  - Switching from paper to live mode requires confirmation and does not affect existing paper positions.

## FO-EXE-005: Position State Machine & Capital Availability Check

> Traces to: `requirements.md` §21.4, §21.5, §25

- Positions shall transition through states: **NEW → PARTIAL_ENTRY → OPEN → PARTIAL_EXIT → CLOSED**, persisted in the `positions` table `state` column.
- Position states shall be visible in the GUI Position Monitor Panel.
- Partial fills shall transition positions between states: a partial entry fill moves NEW → PARTIAL_ENTRY; full fill moves to OPEN.
- The system shall evaluate **capital availability** before allowing new entries:
  - `available_capital = total_equity - sum(open_position_values)`
  - `RiskManager.can_enter_new(signal, account_state)` returns True only if remaining capital covers the position.
- The GUI shall display: total equity, capital in use, capital available, max allocation limit, and "Can enter next stock? Yes/No" indicator.
- Users shall be able to **override the auto-calculated trade quantity** via the GUI Execution Panel before confirming a trade.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - A new order submission sets position state to NEW; a partial fill changes state to PARTIAL_ENTRY; full fill changes to OPEN.
  - A partial exit fill changes state from OPEN to PARTIAL_EXIT; full exit changes to CLOSED.
  - `can_enter_new()` returns False when capital utilisation exceeds `max_allocation_pct`.
  - User quantity override is respected: if user enters 300 shares (vs auto-calc of 500), exactly 300 shares are submitted.
  - Position states persist across sessions and are correctly restored on startup.

## FO-EXE-006: Intraday Candle Readiness for Execution (Phase 1 — Download)

> Traces to: `requirements.md` §10, §21.4

- The system shall, upon receiving the latest screened stock list, download intraday OHLCV candles (1 m source bars, aggregated to 3 m and 15 m) for every symbol in the list and persist them in the database, ensuring a minimum of **390 candles per derived timeframe** are available before the next trading session begins.
- The download shall be **delta-aware**: if candle data already exists for a symbol, only candles for timestamps after the last stored bar shall be fetched; no re-downloading of existing bars.
- Candles for derived timeframes (3 m, 15 m) shall be **aggregated from 1 m source bars** using the `HistoricalDataEngine.aggregate_timeframe()` method defined in INF-003.003; IBKR API calls shall be made only for 1 m bars.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Given a stock list of N symbols and an empty database, after the download job completes, every symbol has ≥ 390 rows in the `price_1m`-derived 3 m and 15 m aggregated views.
  - Given a symbol with 350 existing 3 m bars, the system fetches only the missing bars and brings the count to ≥ 390 without duplicating existing rows.
  - Given a symbol that fails data fetch (IBKR error, rate-limit, etc.), that symbol is logged as failed and the download continues for remaining symbols.
  - The download job completes idempotently: running it twice on the same data produces no duplicate rows and no errors.

## FO-EXE-007: Live 3m Candle Formation During Trading Hours (Phase 2 — Live Feed)

> Traces to: `requirements.md` §10, §21.4
> Depends on: FO-EXE-006 (Phase 1 base candles must be present before live feed starts)

- During Regular Trading Hours (RTH: 09:30–16:00 ET, Monday–Friday), the system shall maintain a **live 3m candle** for every symbol in the active screened list by accumulating IBKR real-time 5-second bars (sourced via `IBKRClient.subscribe_realtime_bars()`) into per-symbol partial bars in memory.
- A **partial bar** tracks `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, and `volume` for the current 3-minute window. On every incoming 5-second bar the partial bar is updated: `high = max(high, bar.high)`, `low = min(low, bar.low)`, `close = bar.close`, `volume += bar.volume`; `open` is set only on the first tick of a new window.
- On each **3-minute boundary** (wall-clock aligned to :00/:03/:06/…/:57 ET), the system shall:
  1. Finalise the completed partial bar as an `OHLCVBar` with `timeframe = '3m'`.
  2. Persist it to the database via `DatabaseManager.insert_bars()` (idempotent; duplicate timestamps are silently ignored).
  3. Emit a `candle_closed(symbol: str, bar: OHLCVBar)` PyQt signal to all downstream subscribers (Strategy Engine, GUI Chart Panel).
- After each 5-second tick update (before the bar closes), the system shall emit a `candle_updated(symbol: str, partial: PartialBar)` signal so the GUI can display a live in-progress candle without waiting for the 3-minute close.
- The live feed shall subscribe only to symbols in the **current active screened list**. Symbols added or removed from the list shall be subscribed/unsubscribed dynamically without restarting the aggregator.
- The system shall operate **only within RTH**. Outside RTH the aggregator discards incoming 5-second bars without updating any partial bar or emitting signals. If a partial bar is open at 16:00:00 ET it is discarded (not persisted).
- On **connection loss** mid-bar, the in-progress partial bar for each symbol is discarded. When the feed reconnects, a fresh partial bar starts on the next 3-minute boundary.
- The live 3m candles produced by this feature extend the Phase 1 historical base: after a `candle_closed` event, the symbol's 3m candle count increases by 1 and `get_readiness_report()` must reflect the updated count.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - At 09:33:00 ET, given 6 received 5-second bars for AAPL since 09:30:00, a `candle_closed` signal fires with a completed `OHLCVBar(symbol='AAPL', timeframe='3m', open=…, high=…, low=…, close=…, volume=…)` and the bar is persisted to the database.
  - Immediately after a 5-second bar arrives mid-window, a `candle_updated` signal fires with a `PartialBar` reflecting the running OHLC + cumulative volume; no DB write occurs.
  - Given AAPL is removed from the active screened list at 10:05 ET, no further `candle_closed` or `candle_updated` signals are emitted for AAPL, and the IBKR real-time subscription for AAPL is cancelled.
  - At 16:00:00 ET an open partial bar is discarded; no `candle_closed` signal fires and no incomplete bar is written to the database.
  - After a simulated IBKR disconnect at 10:15:30 ET (mid-bar), the in-progress partial bar is cleared; on reconnect at 10:16:45 ET a fresh partial bar starts at the next 3-minute boundary (10:18:00 ET) with no gap row inserted.
  - Running `get_readiness_report(['AAPL'])` after the 09:33:00 `candle_closed` event returns `candles_3m` = (prior count + 1).

## FO-EXE-008: Live Market Data Tick Worker

**Status:** Approved
**Priority:** Must
**Depends on:** FO-EXE-007 (IBKR ib_insync connection pattern reused)
**Source:** GUI streaming price requirement — FO-GUI-012

The system shall provide a `LiveTickWorker` QThread module that maintains IBKR `reqMktData` streaming subscriptions for a caller-supplied set of tagged contracts and emits per-symbol last-price signals to the GUI. This worker owns its own `ib_insync.IB()` connection and dedicated IBKR client ID (`SystemConfig.ibkr_tick_client_id`, default 14), keeping it fully isolated from the candle bar worker (clientId 13) and historical loader (clientId 12).

### Requirements

1. `LiveTickWorker` accepts a tagged contract mapping `dict[str, Contract]` (tag → ib_insync Contract). Tags are the caller-visible identifiers (e.g., `"AAPL"`, `"^GSPC"`) used in emitted signals.
2. The worker emits `tick_price = pyqtSignal(str, float)` — `(tag, last_price)` — whenever `ib.pendingTickersEvent` fires and a non-NaN price is available. Price resolution priority: `ticker.last → ticker.close → skip`.
3. The worker emits `subscription_failed = pyqtSignal(str, int)` — `(tag, ibkr_error_code)` — on IBKR error codes 162, 354, or 420 for a specific contract, then removes that tag from active subscriptions. Other subscriptions are unaffected.
4. `set_contracts(contracts: dict[str, Contract])` dynamically reconciles the active subscription set: new tags are subscribed, removed tags have their `reqMktData` cancelled. Subscriptions are batched in groups of 10 with a 200 ms pause between batches to respect IBKR pacing limits.
5. `request_stop()` cancels all active `reqMktData` subscriptions, then disconnects and exits the event loop — following the same safe-stop pattern as `LiveBarWorker.request_stop()`.
6. The worker does **not** apply any RTH filter. `reqMktData` market-data streams whenever the exchange publishes quotes; the caller (AppService) decides whether to display or suppress values outside trading hours.
7. Reconnect on dropped connection is not in scope for this FO; the caller (AppService) tears down and restarts the worker on feed reconnect events.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Within 500 ms of `set_contracts({"AAPL": stk_contract})` while the IBKR feed is live, at least one `tick_price("AAPL", price)` signal fires.
2. After `set_contracts({})` removes AAPL, no further `tick_price("AAPL", …)` signals fire.
3. IBKR error 354 ("No market data permission") for AAPL → `subscription_failed("AAPL", 354)` emitted within 2 s; `tick_price` for all other active symbols continues uninterrupted.
4. `request_stop()` completes within 3 s: all reqMktData subscriptions cancelled, IBKR connection closed, QThread exits cleanly.
5. Concurrent `set_contracts()` calls while the worker is running do not cause duplicate subscriptions or segfaults.
6. A `SystemConfig.ibkr_tick_client_id` collision (IBKR error 326) is logged at WARNING level and the worker retries with `ibkr_tick_client_id + 1` up to 3 times before emitting a connection-failed signal.
